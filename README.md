## What is HOTP?

TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) is a method to generate a one-time password using a secret key and a time counter to ensure secure authentication.

## Why is it important?

It prevents password reuse and ensures that each login attempt is unique, enhancing security against unauthorized access.

## How it works

This program allows you to store an initial password in a file and is also capable of generating a new one-time password every time it is requested.

### Usage:

```
python3 main.py -g file_with_hexadecimal_key.txt
python3 main.py -k key_file.key
python3 main.py -s
```

- **`-g:`** The program receives as an argument a hexadecimal key of at least 64 characters. The program stores this key safely in a file called `ft_otp.key`, which is encrypted.
- **`-k:`** The program generates a new temporary password based on the key given.
- **`-s:`** The program generates randomizes a key and a QR Code compatible with Google Authenticator.

Below is an example of use:

```
$ echo -n "NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP" > key.txt
$ ./ft_otp -g key.txt
./ft_otp: error: key must be 64 hexadecimal characters.
$ [..]
$ cat key.hex | wc -c
64
$ ./ft_otp -g key.hex
QR Code saved in qrcode.png
Key saved in ft_otp.key
$ ./ft_otp -k ft_otp.key
836492
$ sleep 60
$ ./ft_otp -k ft_otp.key
123518
```

## Features

- The program uses the TOTP algorithm as described in [RFC 4226](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt) and is based on the HOTP algorithm as describe in [RFC 6238](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238).
- The generated one-time password is random and always contains the same format, i.e., 6 digits.
- The program creates a QR Code with seed generation.

## More about RFC HOTP

### Key components:

- **Secret Key (K):** A shared private key known by both the client (user) and the server.
- **Time counter (C):** A time counter obtained by accessing the system time.
- **HMAC-SHA1:** A cryptographic function used to combine the secret key and counter into a hash.
- **Digits (d):** The length of the OTP (6 digits in our case).

### Steps to generate an TOTP:

Refer to the detailed steps above for generating an TOTP.


1. **Take the counter value:**
   - The counter (C) is an integer, but it is treated as an 8-byte (64-bit) binary value for processing.

2. **Compute the HMAC:**
   - Use the secret key (K) and the counter (C) to compute the HMAC. The result is a 20-byte hash (since SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash).

3. **Perform dynamic truncation:**
   - Extract a 4-byte portion of the hash:
     - Take the last nibble (4 bits) of the HMAC to determine an offset value (o).
     - Extract the 4 bytes starting at the offset (o) in the HMAC.
     - Convert these 4 bytes into a 31-bit positive integer (code).

4. **Reduce the code to the desired number of digits:**
   - Take `code % 10^d` to reduce to 6 digits.

## Pseudo-code

```
function HOTP(K, C, d):
    # Step 1: Convert the counter to an 8-byte binary value
    C_bin = to_8_byte_binary(C)
    
    # Step 2: Compute the HMAC-SHA1 of the key and counter
    HMAC = HMAC_SHA1(K, C_bin)
    
    # Step 3: Dynamic Truncation
    # Get the last 4 bits of the HMAC to find the offset
    o = HMAC[19] & 0x0F  # HMAC[19] is the last byte; & 0x0F keeps the last 4 bits
    
    # Extract 4 bytes starting at the offset
    binary_code = (HMAC[o] & 0x7F) << 24 |  # First byte (remove sign bit)
                  (HMAC[o+1] & 0xFF) << 16 | # Second byte
                  (HMAC[o+2] & 0xFF) << 8  | # Third byte
                  (HMAC[o+3] & 0xFF)        # Fourth byte
    
    # Step 4: Reduce to desired number of digits
    OTP = binary_code % (10 ** d)
    
    return OTP
```
